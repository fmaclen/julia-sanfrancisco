1. Introduction
---------------

Everyone knows Carmen Sandiego, but nobody knows where she is.  She has to be
the most notorious criminal in the world.  She was trained as a spy, but now
runs a criminal organization known as V.I.L.E.  Your mission is to stop them,
and my mission is to tell you how to stop all of Carmen's flunkies until you're
skilled enough to take a shot (or two, or three) at Carmen herself.

You see my e-mail address at the top?  If you can't figure out what I added to
block spam, you don't deserve to e-mail me.  As long as you're capable of
taking out useless info, you can e-mail me with any questions or comments.  Put
the word FAQ in the title.  Now, shall we begin?


2. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
-----------------------------------

If you have a question about this game or this guide, read this.  If you still
have a question, you can then e-mail me.  If you ask something I answer in
here, you will be blocked.  So read this first.

Q: What is this clock for?
A: The clock is not real-time.  It limits you to a certain number of actions.
You are almost always given enough time to investigate every building in every
correct location, but don't goof around once you know the criminal and where to
go next.  You have to sleep, which means that when the clock reaches 11:00 PM,
you're out until 8:00 AM the next morning.  What's worse, if you were partway
through any operation, you continue the next morning, and must still use the
full time.  You're not even smart enough to sleep on the plane.

Q: What do you mean by "search the area" and "look around"?
A: Use all three of the green commands in the search menu.  This gathers
information about your next destination as well as the criminal.

Q: Why do I need a warrant if I found the criminal with the loot?
A: You need a warrant to search them for whatever they stole.  Otherwise you
don't get credit for the case and they go free.

Q: Why did an axe or knife fly across the screen at me, or a gun pop out and
shoot?
A: You're in the same city as the criminal.  Search the area and they'll come
out.

Q: Why did you write this?
A: There are a few reasons, I guess.  The first is that I was bored and decided
to play this game.  I wanted to see if there were any FAQs on it, so I could
see the list of criminals.  Sadly, there was not.  That would be reason two,
because nobody else had yet.  As to why I bothered to finish it, see the very
last two lines of the guide.

Q: Anything else?
A: You can listen to the theme song at http://witwicsd.ytmnd.com/ and bring
back memories.  If you have no memories of the show, I have no idea why you
would even consider playing this game.  But the song is decent anyway.


3. How to Play
--------------

The menu system in this game is kind of difficult to learn.  There are four
buttons in a toolbar along the bottom right.  From left to right, they display:
The word "options" (Game Options Menu)
An airplane (Travel Menu)
A magnifying glass (Search Menu)
A computer (Data Menu)

The functions of each menu are as follows.  Any function that takes time will
have the amount of time noted.

Game Options Menu: This menu displays six options.  "About Carmen" displays
the credits for the game.  "Show Password" gives you a three letter password
to return to your point in the game.  "Select Language" allows you to change
the in game language between the five settings.  "Review Brief" repeats the
information given to you at the beginning of a level.  "Quit Game" asks you if
you're sure, gives you a password, and then returns you to the title screen.
Finally, "Exit menu" lets you select another menu.

Travel Menu: This menu displays three to five travel destinations.  Selecting
the one you are currently at takes no time, and returns you to the menu.
Selecting any other location will take 2-6 hours and put you at that location.

Search Menu: This menu displays four options.  The first three will be
buildings.  Choosing the leftmost building takes two or three hours.  The
central building takes three or four hours.  The rightmost building takes three
to six hours.  At each building, you are given information about what a person
there knows about the thief and their destination.  If you accidentally revisit
a building, there is no additional time penalty.  Finally, "Exit menu" lets you
select another menu.

Data Menu: This menu displays three options.  "Warrant" allows you to input
your gathered information about the criminal and determine the culprit.  To get
the results back takes three hours, and a warrant will be issued if you have
been specific enough.  "Dossiers" displays the information on each of the ten
criminals.  This information is provided in section 5.  Finally, "Exit menu"
lets you select another menu.


4. Walkthrough
--------------

So, now you know how to play, and you're ready to get down to solving things.
Unfortunately, the cases are selected in random order.  And you can even bust
the same criminal twice in a row.  You begin as a Rookie.  After one case, you
are promoted to Cadet.  Four more criminals earns you the title of Private Eye.
A whopping seven more earns you the rank of Investigator.  Eight after that
gives you the title of Ace Detective. Then you can feel happy, since you only
need ten more to complete the game!  For directions on how to solve specific
cases, see the guidelines in the next section.


4A. Basic Guidelines
--------------------

In a normal game, I could list each of the places, and list all the possible
thefts and criminals, so you could just match up your case to a list and be
done with it.  Unfortunately, after extensive testing, the criminal is actually
completely random in each case, excepting the final one.  To further complicate
matters, the locations, paths, and crimes are always random.  So instead, I
have provided a list of guidelines on how to proceed, as well as a list of
which clues signify which locations and criminals.  Together, these three
elements create a flexible walkthrough that can be used to complete each
possible combination with minimal effort.

1. Before you start, half the suspects will be eliminated because you learn the
gender of the criminal.  Remember this or write it down.

2. As soon as you start a case, search the area.  People in the first city
might not know anything, or they might be able to completely identify the
criminal.  Watch for any mention of hair color, hobby, vehicle, or an
identifying mark or object.  Ignore anything mentioning food, boats, or planes.

3. Pay close attention to the clues about location that each person gives to
you.  Once you have them, use the City Clues sections to determine where you
need to go next.  Going to the wrong place will waste a minimum of six hours.
In some harder levels, you can't afford that.

4. Do not attempt to get a warrant until you know three of the five details
about the criminal.  Note that the gender you got in step one is one of the 
three.  Three clues will give you a warrant in all but three scenarios, which
are listed in guideline 4A.  Once you do have enough for a warrant, get it as
soon as possible, before you forget.  If you want to complete the game as
quickly as possible, check the Dossiers section once you have two clues.  A few
criminals can be identified with only gender and one other clue.

4A. A male who likes croquet and drives a limousine may be either Ihor
Ihorovich or Scar Graynolt.   You will need to obtain another clue to determine
who the criminal is.
    A female with brown hair who enjoys mountain climbing may be Merey LaRoc or
Katherine Drib.  You will need to obtain another clue to determine who the
criminal is.
    A female with brown hair wearing fancy jewelry is Merey LaRoc, unless you
are on the final case.  Use the three clues you have along with the hobby of
mountain climbing to obtain a warrant.  If you are on case thirty, see
guideline 8 to obtain your warrant.

5. Check every building (exception: guideline 6) until you know the thief and
get a warrant.  After that, once you get a good clue, move on.  If you can save
time in one city, it's never a bad thing.  You have no reason to interrogate
everyone once you know who you're after.  Again, check each clue against the
lists in the City Clues section to see when you have enough information to
move on.

6. If the central building is a clue about the flag, don't waste your time in
the rightmost building.  A huge majority of the time they will have the same
exact clue, and even if it is unique, you won't ever need it, unless you decide
not to use the City Clue lists for some reason.

7. If people start telling you to watch out, and random weapons fly across the
screen, search every building to find your thief.  If you manage to do this
before 5:00 Sunday, and you have a warrant, you make progress.  If you fail in
either aspect, you get nothing and have to start the case over, with a
different set of locations and a new criminal.  This game is long enough, so
follow the strategy above and you'll keep the repetition to a minimum.

8. Once you manage to complete 29 cases, you will be chasing Carmen Sandiego
for your final case.  In this case, you'll need to use a different strategy.
You should immediately get your warrant.  Female, brown hair, convertible will
give you one for Carmen.  Don't worry about gathering clues, it's always her.
Also, by this time, you should know every location by one or two clues.  You
need to use as few as possible.  Even using only one clue from each city, I
didn't get near Carmen until late Friday.  She makes a lot of stops.  Don't be
irritated if you have to do this one a couple times before it all plays out the
right way.  Once you do catch her, enjoy the mediocre ending.  You've earned
it, for sitting through all thirty of these cases.


4B. Generic City Clues
----------------------

There are only a few generic clues, and one is not specific enough to determine
which city the criminal in question has fled to.  However, if you check the
list of possible travel options, one or two of these clues can be sufficient a
great majority of the time.  Currency, flag colors, and leadership details are
considered generic clues.  Each type has a section below, followed by a list of
possible details in alphabetical order, and a list of which cities those
details could indicate.  If you have any other type of clue, check the Specific

4C. Specific Clues
------------------

These are the most useful clues.  With very few exceptions, these clues will
tell you exactly where to find the thief.  If there is an exception, the semi-
useful clues will be marked with an asterisk, and relevant information is
provided that the bottom of that section.  If you get a clue that does not fall
under a category in the above list, you will find it listed under the building
where it can be received here.  To conserve space, the city is the main entry.
The details that point to a specific city are listed under that city's name.
To find the clue you're looking for, use Ctrl+F. These lists also indicate that
certain buildings are better to go to for clues. Museums and libraries are by
far the most useful, as other buildings give these clues less often.

Warning: "Volcano" is a horrible keyword to search for.  Although every clue
can be uniquely identified, some are very similar, and others are exactly the
same but from different buildings.  Be very careful if you choose to try to use
a volcano clue.  This is why all clues containing the word volcano are marked
with a percent sign (%).

Stock Market/Marketplace Clues: These are objects that the thief would like to
buy, sell, or trade.  These buildings rarely appear, and sometimes give clues
about currency instead of these clues.

5. Dossiers
-----------

This is here so that you know whether or not you have enough information for a
warrant. The in-game information can get confusing, and trying for a warrant
only to find that you need more information takes valuable time, so comparing
your notes to this list could be very handy.

6. Legal Stuff
--------------

Here is where most authors tell you never to take their work and post it or
sell it anywhere ever or they will take their crack team of lawyers and hunt
you down.  Well, I have a different policy.

If you want to post my guide, or use a portion of it, just mention me.  You
don't have to tell me, although a thank you message is always appreciated.  I'm
just glad if someone finds a use for this.  If you want to sell this, and you
actually find someone dumb enough to pay money for it, go ahead and sell it.
In fact, feel free to e-mail me and gloat about how you sold this to someone.
I'll laugh at the moron right along with you.  Basically, use it how you like,
and if it's not too much trouble, let me know.

Also, all trademarks and copyrights contained in this document are owned by
their respective trademark and copyright holders.  This guide is not endorsed
by any individual other than myself.


7. Version History
------------------

Version 2.1 (8/30/05) - Nothing major, just a few formatting changes that
I noticed while writing my next FAQ.

Version 2.0 (8/16/04) - I finished off the guide.  There should be no more
missing clues, but if you find something really, really rare that I managed to
miss, let me know.  The descriptions and guidelines are much clearer in this
version.

Version 1.51 (3/28/04) - E-mail address change.

Version 1.5 (3/21/04) - Added most of the clue lists to the walkthrough
section.  There are thirty empty spaces, and a few extras still missing, but a
large majority is done.

Version 1.0 (3/15/04) - I put together the basic information on how to play the
game and submitted.


8. Conclusion
-------------

There, wasn't that fun?  Yeah, I didn't think so either, but maybe someone did.
Congratulations on wasting your life.  I'd like to take this opportunity to
thank a few companies/people/hideous demons.

Nintendo - Because I played it on a Super NES.

Broderbund and Electronic Arts - For making this game, since without the game,
this walkthrough wouldn't be here.

CJayC - For creating GameFAQs and posting this walkthrough, along with
thousands of other useful documents on almost every game ever made.

Auriga - For listening to me ramble on and on and on about my current progress.
He also gave me the information on the flag colors, which I had completely
skipped over in my rush to do the harder clue lists.

Carmen Sandiego - For hiding so well.

The demon in my brain - For making me insane, such that I must complete every
game I ever play.  I hate him most of the time, but this walkthrough wouldn't
exist without him.
