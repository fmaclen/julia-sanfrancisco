  GENERALITIES

  It's a good idea to know the countries and their capitals.  There are 
actually only thirty.  This will give you an inevitable advantage.  
Also, you shouldn't have a problem with time if you don't make any 
mistakes.  Searching any one place takes two to four hours, calling 
Interpol takes two to three, and plane trips take a varying amount of 
time, usually six hours.
  My advice is to write down any clues you are not sure about to 
facilitate further cases, because the game is small enough that they 
will crop up again.  But even if you miss out on a case, you get no 
penalty.
  Also, note that with over ten cases before capturing Carmen you will 
definitely capture one henchman more than once.  You also have at least 
a 50% chance of having to rescue the same treasure twice.
P = 1 - (89/90 * 88/90 * ... * 77/90) assuming you never miss a case.

  YOUR RANK

Your rank:
0 cases solved = rookie
1-3 cases solved = sleuth
4-6 cases solved = private eye
7-9 cases solved = investigator
10-13 cases solved = ace detective
14 cases solved : you get your name in the hall of fame.

Note that a lot of the options are, in fact, bogus.  The fake hobbies 
are music, skydiving, and swimming.  The fake features are limp and 
scar.  The fake automobile is the race car.  All hair types are real, 
but there are no brunette men or black-haired women.

  HOW TO NAIL BAD GUYS, THE DETAILS

   First of all, in any new city, you take two hours to visit the first 
location, three for the second, and four for all additional ones.  If 
you get a clue wrong and return, your next visit will be two hours.  
Visiting Interpol takes two to three hours for each inquiry.
