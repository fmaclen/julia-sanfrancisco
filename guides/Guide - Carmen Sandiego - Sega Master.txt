IV.    Solving Cases

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Gathering Clues

Every city has five points of interest: an airport, three buildings, and a
phone booth.  The airport is used to book flights, the phone booth to obtain a
warrant, and the buildings are where you gather clues.

There are two types of clues: those about your suspect's whereabouts and those
about the suspect.  These help you identify the next city you need to fly to
as well as how to fill out the warrant.

The clues given are based on the particular building such as banks telling you 
about currencies and libraries about culture.  Use them to figure out where to
go next (see the cities section for a list of clues about each city).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Time

You begin each case at 07:00 Monday morning and have until 17:00 Sunday
afternoon to apprehend your suspect.  Here is a list of activities that consume
time and how much you lose for each one:

-  Entering a building (1 hr for 1st, 2 for 2nd, 3 for 3rd)
-  Applying for a warrant (3 hrs)
-  Getting hit by a knife (2 hrs 1st time, 2 more each additional time)
-  Getting shot (4 hrs 1st time, 4 more each additional)
-  Sleeping (9 hrs every night)
-  Flying (variable based on distance)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  V.I.L.E. Henchmen

As you follow your suspect from city to city, you will encounter V.I.L.E
henchmen.  When they appear on screen, the text screen at the bottom will
turn brown and a musical note will play.  Henchmen will throw a single knife
at you, duck or jump to avoid it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Obtaining a Warrant

In order to arrest the suspect, you'll need a proper warrant.  As you gather
clues, sometimes the witnesses will mention things about the suspect.  Some
are straightforward ("She had brown hair.") while others require a small amount
of thought ("He was carrying a helmet." means that he rides a motorcycle).

To apply for a warrant, you just enter the phone booth located at the far left
of any city and fill out the data that you know.  You will usually need to
know two details other than gender to narrow down the suspects.  There is a 
lot of overlap (especially with the female suspects) so be sure that you have
enough information.

After filling out the information, select Continue to apply for the warrant
(application takes three hours off your clock).  You'll then either be given
a warrant or a list of suspects that match your search (meaning you need more
information to narrow it down).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  Apprehending the Suspect

You'll know you've found your suspect when upon entering buildings you are
given warnings instead of clues.  The suspect will make him/herself known once
you have entered a building or two (if they stay hidden, try walking all the
way to the left then start walking to the right).  When walking through the
city it is VERY important to stay at the TOP of the screen!

Once the suspect appears, you need to keep him/her occupied until the cops
arrive to make the arrest.  Unfortunately, they are all packing heat while you
are totally unarmed!  When the suspect appears, head down to the BOTTOM of the
screen to avoid getting shot.  The suspect will then head down to the bottom
with you and fire again, you need to move to the TOP and then JUMP over the
bullet.  You need to time this just right, if you jump too soon you'll land on
the bullet and be laid up for several hours!  Keep doing this until the cops
show up and take the suspect into custody.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.  Victory/Defeat

You successfully solve a case by apprehending the suspect within the allotted
time.  You lose if you apprehend a suspect WITHOUT a proper warrant or if you
fail to apprehend the suspect before 17:00 on Sunday.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.  Ranks

The five ranks are:

Rookie (1 case, 5 cities)
Sleuth (3 cases, 5 cities)
Private Eye (4 cases, 6 cities)
Investigator (5 cases, 6 cities) 
Ace Detective (10 cases, 7/8 cities)

The higher the rank the more difficult the game becomes.  In the higher ranks
the clues become less helpful and require a little more thought and you have
to chase your suspect through more cities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.  General Strategies

-  Banks and Embassies usually give the best clues (flag and currency).

-  In the higher ranks, you will NOT have enough time to visit all three
   buildings in every city.

-  Entering the airport does NOT use any time so make a note of which
   destinations are listed BEFORE searching for clues.

-  ALWAYS travel at the TOP of the screen, this makes avoiding projectiles much
   easier.

-  Carmen Sandiego will ALWAYS be the final suspect(case #10 of Ace Detective).
   It's important to know this because a lot of the female suspects have
   characteristics that overlap with Carmen's, so when obtaining a warrant,
   if she appears with another suspect you can safely eliminate her (unless it 
   IS the final mission).

-  Just in case you missed it, you can hold down button 1 to speed up text and
   animations to make the game move along quicker.

-  If a certain clue has you stumped, try Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org).

VIII.  Game Review

Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? is one of the original educational video
games.  The goal is to hunt down Carmen and her gang of thieves while learning
world geography in the process.

The Sega Master System port is faithful to the original in nearly every aspect
and I highly recommend that SMS owners give it a try.

Pros

+  Captures the spirit of the PC original.
+  Fun and educational!

Cons

-  No save feature.
-  The "gunfights" feel a little out of place.
