### About the project

**Julia Sanfrancisco** is a clone of the 80s MS-DOS game [Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Where_in_the_World_is_Carmen_Sandiego_Enhanced_1989).
This project is meant as a proof-of-concept that leverages generative AI to create the game and it's assets.

### Short-term roadmap

- Implement the game mechanics from the original game
- Generate updated clues for the cities featured in the original game
- Generate new artwork for the cities featured in the original game
- Implement a new mobile-based UI with improved UX

Follow the [current progress here](https://github.com/fmaclen/julia-sanfrancisco/issues).

### Current stack

- Written in Typescript using [`SvelteKit`](https://kit.svelte.dev).
- There is no backend, the game runs entirely on the browser.
- Your `name`, `score` and current `play session` is stored locally on your device.
- Clues have been generated with OpenAI's [`GPT-4`](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4).
- Artwork was generated with Stable Diffusion using [`deliberate_v2`](https://civitai.com/models/4823/deliberate).
